<b>TITLE: FACE DETECTION BY MODELLING COMPLEX DATA DENSITIES</b>
<br></br>
The main objective of this project is to perform face detection by modelling complex data distributions like Single Gaussian Model,
Mixture of Gaussians, T distribution and Factor Analyser
<br></br>

<b>1. GETTING THE DATA : </b>
The first step of this project was to download the face data. For my case I used the University Of Maryland Face dataset available at :
![UMD FACES](http://www.umdfaces.io/").
-After downloading the data, I had to write a Python IO module that cropped the faces from the given annotation files and also cropped a   random part from the image as background.

<b>TITLE: FACE DETECTION BY MODELLING COMPLEX DATA DENSITIES</b>
<br></br>
The main objective of this project is to perform face detection by modelling complex data distributions like Single Gaussian Model,
Mixture of Gaussians, T distribution and Factor Analyser
<br></br>

<b>1. GETTING THE DATA : </b>
The first step of this project was to download the face data. For my case I used the University Of Maryland Face dataset available at :
